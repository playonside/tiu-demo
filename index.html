          <p>5 simple words: <b>”It is not about you”</b>.</p>
          <p>You are on a <b>team</b>.</p>
          <p>When you become part of a team, you give up individual <em>rights</em> and gain team <em>responsibilities</em>.</p>
          <p>You are required to die to self. <em>“Unless a seed falls to the ground and dies, it <b>cannot</b> bear fruit.”</em></p>
          <p>The decision to play on this team is a decision to become part of something <b>bigger</b> than yourself.</p>
          <p>Selflessness <b>builds</b>. Selfishness <b>destroys</b>.</p>
          <p>Our ultimate model in this is Jesus Christ - Philippians 2:5-7</p>

          <p>We must have <b>one</b> unified playing style, and you <b>cannot</b> play for us if you’re not willing to listen to the coaching staff and change your game and habits for the <b>team's</b> benefit.</p>

          <p>We are not looking for ‘solid’ or ‘just good enough’ at TIU</p>
          <p>We are looking for ‘off-the-charts’, ‘barrier-breaking’, ‘record-setting’, ‘I can’t believe I just did that’ fitness!</p>
          <p>I feel that it is fair of me to ask for this and call you to aspire to that level because there really is no clear idea of just how far you can push yourself or go in this area.
          And more importantly, it is <b>completely</b> under your own control.</p>
          <p><em>So much</em> of athletics and competition is <em>outside</em> of our control. However, fitness and conditioning, <b>so vital in soccer</b>, are actually completely under our control. <b>Control The Controllables</b>!</p>

          <p>I would <b>never</b> want to downplay this on my list of desired traits in a <em>complete</em> soccer player. To play this sport collegiately, being strong in the soccer-specific areas is vital and something we want to exist in our program.</p>
